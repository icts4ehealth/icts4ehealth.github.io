	 <center><h5>SS-ICHS: Impact of ChatBots (CBs) in the Healthcare sector</h5></center>
	
	
	<p>In its most basic form, a ChatBot (CB) is an application designed to simulate conversations with human users. It
                            combines the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to respond to user
                            inputs. In the healthcare industry, CBs have the potential to deliver a tremendous impact by providing a range of
                            benefits to both patients and stakeholders, providing strong support to the decision-making process helping the
                            physicians deliver high-quality clinical treatments. Finally, being software-based, CBs can naturally work along
                            with blockchains and cyber-security systems to guarantee complete protection of sensible health-related patient
                            information</p>
